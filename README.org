this is just to try out the standard docker images at 
https://hub.docker.com/r/ocaml/opam/

see "using the containers"

To build an environment for the Jane Street Core library on the latest stable OCaml, a simple Dockerfile looks like this:

FROM ocaml/opam
RUN opam depext -i core

You can build and use this image locally for development by saving the Dockerfile and:

docker build -t ocaml-core .
docker run -ti ocaml-core bash


tjr: currently using tmp as the name of the container
